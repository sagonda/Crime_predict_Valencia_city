# Crime_predict_Valencia_city

This project presents a new crime prediction method based on the prediction of crime types and the
prediction of the geolocation associated with each type of crime. For this purpose, different data have
been used, such as historical data of the different types of crime in the city of Valencia from 2010 to 2020,
calculated points of interest of each type of crime and geolocations of the different types of crime. To try to
solve the problem of predicting the different types of crime and their geolocations, we have used geolocations,
two methods have been used. A first method based on the use of a LSTM network for the prediction of the
type of crime and a second method based on the use of a convolutional network to predict the geolocation of
the type of crime, with these two methods the networks have been able to achieve an accuracy of 96% in the
prediction of the type of crime and its geolocation.
